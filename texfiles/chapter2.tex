\chapter{What is a Field Programmable Gate Array}
A \ac{FPGA} is a chip that is first \emph{field programmable} which means that the chip is reconfigurable after it leaves the foundry or the manufacturer of the chip. For example the \ac{FPGA} could perform the operations of a transceiver then minutes later, after reconfiguration, the \ac{FPGA} can perform image processing algorithms then could act as a web server. Because of this versatility the \ac{FPGA} has become a very cost effective solution as opposed to \ac{ASIC}.

The second aspect of an \ac{FPGA} is that the resources that are available are in a \emph{gate array}. The architecture of the gate array changes with newer versions of \ac{FPGA}. New versions of \ac{FPGA} attempt to optimize the resources for any application the \ac{FPGA} is used. The versatility of the \ac{FPGA} makes this optimization very difficult and because of this the efficiency of the design truly lies on the developer.

The responsibility of code efficiency can be a foreign to traditional software developers especially when the goal is to get code working; efficiency is an afterthought. The idea of \emph{efficiency later} gets \ac{HDL} programmers into trouble. For example if the programmer is not aware that the \ac{RAM} available on the \ac{FPGA} is dual-port and the programmer accesses more than two memory addresses in one clock cycle the synthesizer will interpret the \ac{RAM} as distributed \ac{RAM} instead of Block-\ac{RAM}. Depending on the size of the \ac{RAM} this is a costly mistake because distributed \ac{RAM} is implemented in \ac{LUT} which could be used for other logic. Many examples such as these are found in \ac{HDL} code, and this book aims to list out good practices to avoid such pitfalls.

This Chapter covers a broad topic of what an \ac{FPGA} is and to understand this we will discuss alternatives to the \ac{FPGA}; namely, the \ac{uC} and the \ac{ASIC}. Next, a couple of examples of applications of \ac{FPGA} are discussed for the final section of this chapter in which the resources available on the \ac{FPGA} are described and some common errors seen when using the resources with particular examples from the previous section. 


\section{FPGA Alternatives and Data Rate Capabilities}
There are many platforms for embedded processing. A Raspberry Pi is a very popular platform for the electronics hobbyist and the ARM processor that is available on the Raspberry Pi is very powerful for an embedded processor. However, there are applications, such as image processing, that a little more computing power is needed. This section discusses determining the requirements for the application and determining if a particular platform can handle the data rate required by the application. 

\subsection{Introduction to Data Rate}
A data rate in general is defined as the number of bits per unit time. For a system the data rate is how much data can the system handle per unit time. The overall data rate of the system is the minimum data rate for the individual components. In designing a system with a minimum data rate requirement it is important to be mindful of the data rates of the components.

To make the concept of determining data rate a little more concrete lets look at a simple architecture of a wireless receiver. To determine the data rate of a system the knowledge of the application and more importantly the architecture of the system needs to be known. Even for a simple receiver there are multiple ways to architect the design to enable higher or lower data rates. 


\subsection{Micro-Controllers (uC)}
\ac{uC}'s are embedded processors for use in \emph{small} systems. What is meant by a small system is relative, usually embedded systems are programmed for a specific task. For example live-streaming a webcam to the \ac{LAN}. \ac{uC}'s come in varying sizes; depending on the task to be performed. You don't need the cutting-edge i7 from intel to stream video, but an 8-bit \ac{PIC} \ac{uC} is too small for the task. However, an 8-bit \ac{uC} will turn on a water pump for 10 minutes a day to water a house hold plant. Just as different vehicles suit owner's needs in different ways so do \ac{uC}'s.

\subsection{Application Specific Integrated Circuits}
\ac{ASIC} chips are designed, of course, for a specific application. The knowledge of the algorithms to be calculated and the ability in an \ac{ASIC} to make any gate on the blank silicon make the \ac{ASIC} the most power processing platform. 
 

\section{Applications for FPGAs}
%In general applications for fpga a lend themselves applications for which data rates define hired generate in this section teradata rates in fpj Linda self NFPA 58 implantation lends itself over a microcontroller nfpga can handle names of multiple many streams of parallel incoming or outgoing information microcontroller a decision between an fpga 96 is volume how many units will be sold used by company cost havana section is the application of a transceiver sing and photography all of which have higher data rate requirements

\subsection{Transceivers}
%The transceivers the best examples are Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone contact Tiffany these applications the volume of units sold such as cell phones or Wi-Fi routers the volume have to wear an e-cig would make a cost-effective solution the academic community research into cognitive radios 5th generation Wireless technology determining whether there is a lot of interference in a particular band switching to a different band and communicating their news this is because the higher data rates however go to and we are implementing prototypes on fpgas learning disability of atoms a simple example of a cognitive radio or a simple example of sensing the environment and then transmitting on that all that band is telephone where the playStation 4 hook up to phone for the transceiver and when you first did that the phone and the base station negotiate between two channels noizy which one has less interference it's a simple example of 22 channels that trans smith's information on one channel and then on the second channel the receiver says which one was no easier which one did I get what's the transmitter or the phone no simple algorithm can do that however that out of them is overhead in the Wireless Communications since voice is a state that is relatively low gatorade place that has a relatively low generate can get away with doing this at the beginning make it seamless transition to the phone call in cell phone technology I will get more complicated it won't just be it to him a little bit exciting between for the different users of the cell phones so maybe personne person and person B have two different channels that they are experiencing because they're in two different locations cellular network they both can't use the same frequency because they're still in the range of the cell phone tower has a better frequency ranges that be making sure each user gets frequency band they are clear to transmit denne on top of that if person a is using frequency range strange but there is a wall in there traffic person be good sense white spaces of the band and use that white space to transmit their own date that is the ultimate goal for a cognitive radio however metrics need to be ensured that they don't violate FCC regulations and hinder the communication of transmitter it is the transmitter. Would not have any knowledge or need to have any knowledge of the signal transmitter app just characterizing the regular traffic of transmitter and using the white space in between Transmissions possible ace Transmissions are not regular or they're not predictable than transmitter B would take it pre-action and not transmit on the band idea of how this algorithm of work sampling the environment environment and getting a spectrum map the environment this means nC Rangers time I need to be a balance between sensing and does in general can't do both at the same time in the section with motivated the use of fpga for next-generation transceivers in particular cognitive radio where a continuous or transmitting is needed to operate in these bands

\subsection{Image Processing}
%Image processing image processing is a broad research in this section image image processing does not mean transmitting video over a transceiver if we had high-definition video and we are broadcasting that over a wireless network that would just be a high generate transceiver to be able to broadcast that much data the fall under the previous transceiver application for fpga in this section image processing talk about not only having a a camera taking data so an application of where say road and you want to put a red circle around every car that is driving down the road you can track hcar maybe you want to identify each car maybe you want to try the car and find a license plate of each car these are the applications of image processing that long so it's very well to fpga there are two out rhythms two basic items that come to mind for image processing first of which is correlation for a two dimensional correlation or we look for a known object may be filled waldo anywhere the Balto book you would know what all that looks like you would need to correlate main difference size of his face biggest faces in the book to the page of the a smaller example of that application smaller example would be you have a 128 by 128 image image when you wanted the terminal where these four pixels are in that 128 by 128 fashion To Figure you can move lacrosse tween the four pixels 4 pixels that is currently overlay Don you determine the Enterprise with the maximum inner product is where those images of where your estimate 3x tomatoes for pizza sauce the reason why this application lends itself to his pj's so well is that as you were sampling the high resolution azure sampling the high-resolution images from the camera the inner product the inner product of the four pixels application image for is independent of the inner product of the four pixels when's the state is available wait until the rest of the image is in the LPGA you can be operating on this while you're out ceiling frame from the camera a lot of times in high speed generate or how long to digital converters multiple lanes are provided at the same clock cycle so maybe instead of depending on the speed of the camera can you get 42 pixels rising edge of the clock maybe that represents one half of 1/5 of a column in the image so in this case and that example 16 calculations can start 16 calculations of calculations for 16 independent inter products can start the other application are the other algorithm for image processing has the deal with eigenvalue or some sort of naked Matrix decomposition I'd refer you to reference

\subsection{Cryptography}
%Sakura Transmissions also a great application for fpgas is it because the extreme that you would normally send in the clear available to you on the fpga it's what you're interested in any way the images that you wanted the transmitter or the text that you wanted to oyster as that voice data or images are being processed you can provide this to and intensity on the fpga to encrypt that information and you don't need to wait for all of the information to be available to you cryptographic are there such as elliptic curve cryptography or RSA pS 128 or 256 the show albums random very well to an fpga Plantation for more information on this topic please visit Wikipedia

\section{Architecture of an FPGA}
%Architecture of an fpga provides many resource blocks to the user for processing is resource blocks include Black Ram restoring information the user as the user is programming dedicated multipliers because multiplication and division in Hardware is resource-intensive if using look up tables there are dedicated multipliers available on certain models of fpga from the different vendors is also the switching matrices which are for which data can be routed throughout the year those look up tables clock trees and global inputs and outputs from the SPCA to get your data in today at PGA and off of you quickly this section will discuss all of the resources available to the user on the mpg

\subsection{Block RAM}
%Black Ram is a dedicated memory to the user must be used carefully is my block right and need to be used carefully because most of the time block Ram has either a single or dual port single or dual program because of this only one or two respectively memory blocks Indiana candy addressed in one clock cycle if your Hardware or if your vehicle is accessing multiple addresses the same clock from the same block Ram the synthesizer will interpret this as distributed instantiate that on the fpga fabric and not use block Ram it's a very inefficient use of distributor of your fpga resources you should be redesigned to pool from the Block Ram one or two depending on the architecture of the block grant you using on your fpga under 1 Clarkson


\subsection{Multipliers}
%Multiplier
%Multipliers are dedicated Hardware that can be used on any claw catch multiply two values they can also be used for division for applications such as image processing or wireless transceiver filters for manipulation alone Souls very well that using the dedicated multiplier all the major vendors for fpga provide more dedicated multipliers

\subsection{Switching Matrices}
%switching matrices are used to Route information from resource block searches look up tables and other resources switching matrices can you can think of as interceptions in a city block where the switching matrices are configured at startup to wrap hair in a certain direction writing in a certain direction switching matrices can be configured once at startup and after that they are I can figure out certain way what is possible that you can figure matrix does cut off other resources from the user the place and Route algorithm in nevados Arizona suppose Idaho tool and Altera quartus tool try to optimize this wrapped root price of Maserati my the routing optimize the oh my Godrouting due to the complexity of the lpga's resources complexity of the albums that are being developed for fpga say please and write algorithms are very it is not uncommon for design Institute hours place around


\subsection{Look Up Tables}
%Look up tables who used to do the on the fpga they can be configured in 4many different ways 4 amp five important 16 plus we're fixin to go in any set of outputs can be driven from the inputs defenders of the lpga's have different texas for the Lots what are packaged into aces or carbs slices or C RVs the slices RC Arby's table have a multiplexer and have a register inside them these registers there can be used or not use depending on the algorithm and the multiplexer is configured to Output the results from the left or help with the register having an understanding of the architecture of the fpj you're targeting whether it's 1206 input for input food fit on the internet the synthesizer and the place and route job easier understand the architecture of the board they are targeting


\subsection{Clock Trees}
%Clock trees are resources that are used in every desire every synchronous design clock trees are a dedicated source for providing the clocks to all of your entities and all of your logic set of the logic that is fpga is because it offset between areas of the fpga there could be timing violations violations occurred when the isn't that a steady-state rock Rises or Falls and that Value Inn correct value is registered if you have clock skew or clock differences between pGA you maybe bring a string values from another at the fpga an inaccurate time dedicated dedicated 4 o'clock that minimize in vhdl if you say it's rising it and then whatever the verizon Edge is that value will be allocated a clock in the clock tree it is important to not get your clock it is important to not put signals you don't want to be considered a clock price match if rising Edge

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
%The most designed pleasing to the outside world or referrals on the board is going to be necessary whether it's there a microphone the ethernet the push button LED any of these are inputs and outputs to the there are different size packages and different size models of fpga is providing different amounts of CO2 the SPCA low voltage differential signaling most of the LPGA high bandwidth my clock frequency data rate are hiding rate for the SPCA in determining which fpga is right for you and how many inputs and outputs you would need to your fpga is necessary
