\section{Combinatorial vs. Sequential Logic}
Sequential Growth Company tutorial logic combinatorial logic sequential logic is who has programmed in C or any other high-level language is pretty pretty simple sequential logic logic that happens sequential logic is completed one time step at a time the concept of time in an fpga is to notify clock falling out of a clock so if a + b it is added on the first rising and then the result of a + b is rise Against good idea how to complete tasks in a timely manner another concept is camping tutorial logic common tutorial logic is where the only delays in the system is the propagation delay of the volts is going through dates gates fpga the coming to Tori illogic results design will increase will decrease latency however the longer the delays in the combinatorial logic what's in a lower 2040 fpga the camera tutorial logic must finish its calculations the propagation delay just finished before the next Rising Edge or falling out of the clock the results going to be registered and needs to be done but I freaking End

\subsection{Adder Example}
In the figure is an example of a, that's where logic adder the only the only dates in the design are and and or Gates there are no registers in the design there's no concept of a clock as soon as I import A and B are valid on those lines the result is calculated if the propagation delay through each gate is 2 nanoseconds the total design will take 49 seconds to complete in the next figure there is a sequential adder the rising edge of the clock nevada line to check to see if the operator that are valid addition is then executed addition is then what the logic in the gates digital designs or fpga designs a combination of sequential and combinatorial logic a true balance of sequential and combinatorial logic is the power is how powerful the fpga can be application lends itself towards this model then the fpga is the right fit for your application example of this is image processing where a camera captures video a series of pictures what's a wee wee taking hi-def aTP data the data rate of that 1080p is whatever it is at 30 frames per second

\section{Pipelining to Increase Data Rate}
Idea of pipelining is very popular in his pj's and is arguably one of the most beneficial aspects of an fpga idea of pipelining is resources dedicated to a particular stage of the algorithm let's say for example we wanted to we wanted to add numbers together fine 8 additions could be operated on first and second could be the first and second numbers could be added second or third and fourth fourth and fifth once that stage of the pipeline is complete the second stage of the pipeline can add the resulting numbers from those on the next Friday night eight additions are calculated for additions an example of the timing diagram we have every Rising Edge a new set of values to be added the fastest way to do this most efficient way is to have a pipeline d'architecture as described here usually the architecture of the solution you were taking software this is because you have the ability in vhdl to instantiate an Adder whenever you need it you need to be using a pretty large microcontroller to be able to add 8 values at the same time in this design or actually adding eight address for the first stage four out of the second stage 2 hours of the third stage and once that her for the last days at any given time all of them are adding different car brands is true that in the microcontroller at the frequency of color is significantly higher advantage to an fpga as you can cool things you can do multiple things simultaneously

\section{Using Multiple Clock Domains}
Using Multiple Clock Domains another advantage to fpgas in a little more advanced topic if using multiple o'clock commands the issue with using multiple confirmations is having metastability in signals that are being registered this is when you are crossing clock commands transition of data from 1 o'clock to make the next either by 500 or by correct that data valvestate signaling that here but in general the using multiple clock demands is very advantageous when the data rate that's coming into the is lower than the adults in your operating frequency if you have if you have a camera that is bringing in images hundred killers are 10 killers and you want to run your system at 200 megahertz the man would be the inputs from the camera talk to me would be the upper of the whole system clock of fpga the system clock to the SPCA after that I can get all this done in a timely manner if there is I can value decomposition or a lot of arithmetic based on imports they take a long time is clear and at a faster rate so that the operations can be done in in a timely manner.
